					<a style="font-size:20px;color:white;">Welcome to my website in the big World Wide Web. This page is inspired by old and new neocities pages that I found while exploring <a style="color:#d53737;text-decoration:none;font-size:20px;" href="https://wiby.me/">Wiby.me</a> <a style="font-size:20px;color:white;">a search engine that can find old usually pre 2009 pages that dont use Javascript. This page will be more oriented towards a personal page for Geicomo where I can put links and projects I think are cool! Whatever is here hopefully meets the theme im going for.<br><br> The whole point of geicomo.com as a whole is just a platform for me to learn HTML and website design and see how far I can take it, currently as you have seen the point is to be OS like and I want to make geicomo.com more like your own computer but without the saving users features (maybe) If you found your way here whos to say what else is out there on geicomo.com... </a>
