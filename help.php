This page has info on how to navigate this webpage. Every link you click will create a "tab" you can move these tabs just like a normal OS graphical window,<br> they can be resized with the gray box in the bottom right or closed in the top right.<br> I have tried to categorize the extentions on links to what I think helps best:
<br><br>
<a>./home<strong>.geic</strong> - <strong>.geic</strong> usually helps bring you to other pages with directorys or <strong>.info</strong> links.<br>
<a>./help<strong>.info</strong> - <strong>.info</strong> give info on Geicomo.com or services and usually does not lead anywhere else.</a><br>
<a>./steam<strong>.web</strong> - <strong>.web</strong> links are links that are outside of the Geicomo.com domain.</a><br>
<a>./cashout<strong>.game</strong> - <strong>.game</strong> will take you to a game by Geicomo.</a>
